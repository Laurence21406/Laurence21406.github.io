	<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. The scene starts where we took off in
	    the last episode with Ross seeing Joey and Rachel kissing. Rosss tares at them.]</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see  that, but.. Let me explain, okay?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: We weren't doing anything!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Rach, he just saw us.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Shhh.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b> (to Rachel): Dude, chill! (to Ross) Okay, we also kissed in  Barbados,
	    but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because
	    I saw you kissing Charlie.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it  ever happened, but..</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: We feel so terrible about this, Ross.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah, but it did happen, so...</p>

	<p>(Ross looks shocked and says nothing.)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Ross?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?</p>

	<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Continued from earlier.]</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ross, say something. Anything.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: So you two are..?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b> and Rachel: Yeah.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: And have you .. ed?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: No, no, no!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: No, no, no!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Probably.</p>

	<p>(Rachel looks at him.)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: No, no!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.  You have every right to go nuts.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: No, but you know what I mean.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.  (Squeaky.) I'm fine!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Really?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Absolutely. (Very Squeaky.) I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know  why
	    it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice)  I'm fine.
	    I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys  kissing. I mean,
	    at first I was like.. (Screams.) But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin'
	    this.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Ross..</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: It's all working out! Me &amp; Charlie, and you two. You know what
	    we should do?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Calm ourselves?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.
	    I'll cook!!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if
	    someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! (Storms
	    off.)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I do like fajitas.</p>


	<p>[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Chandler are there. They have lots of
	    brochures about adoption in front of them.]</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's
	    inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways
	    to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: There's a hair in my coffee.</p>

	<p>(Phoebe enters.)</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hey guys!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Hey.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with
	    the triplets.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You know, it's funny. Every time you say &quot;triplets,&quot; I
	    immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.</p>

	<p>(Monica glares at him.)</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: That's sweet. Drink your hair.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hey, what's all this stuff?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: That's not really how it works.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, how does it work?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: I don't know!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my
	    friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help
	    you.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be
	    great?</p>

	<p>(Chandler looks like he did the time he swallowed the toy in 605 TOW
	    Joey's Porsche. It's the hair in his coffee.)</p>

	<p>(Frank Jr. and the triplets enter.)</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about.
	    When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.</p>

	<p>(The triplets scream and run amok in the coffeehouse.)</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: That's not what we talked about!!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hey!</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Hey.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Good to see you.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Good to see you, too.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Hi Frank.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Hi, how you doin'?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!</p>

	<p>(Little Chandler is pulling Chandler's sweater, while Leslie is
	    throwing bagels at him.)</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Which one is which again?</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the
	    lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's
	    Leslie throwing bagels at him.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b> (reads a form in her lap): &quot;Willing to adopt triplets?&quot; No!</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: The hallway in Ross's building. Joey and Rachel are on their
	    way to Ross's dinner.]</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's
	    cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our
	    first date.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Well, what would we be doing?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy
	    dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Feel me up?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: In a carriage!</p>

	<p>(Charlie walks up to them.)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Hey, Charlie!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Hey.</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, you bet.</p>

	<p>(Joey sees that she's carrying a small red bag.)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: So, did you bring a little something for Ross?</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Oh. Oh, thanks.</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you
	    want.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..</p>

	<p>(They enter Ross's apartment. Ross is already quite hyper.)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey.
	    (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new
	    girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He
	    squeezes her hand.) Come, please come in. Come in.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Okay, well, we brought you some wine.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) She's a keeper. And what
	    did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Uh, actually, that's..</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these
	    things!!</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you?
	    You see? Who else is fine?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe
	    have a drink.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a
	    pitcher of Margaritas.</p>

	<p>(Does a Mexican dancing-thing before going to the kitchen.)</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there.
	    The triplets are now sleeping on top of each other on the couch.]</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you
	    know it, they're gonna be awake again.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Yeah.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest
	    thing..</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: I haven't slept in four years!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: That's a, that's a long time.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so
	    many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold
	    one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with
	    his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's
	    three of them, Phoebe, three!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out
	    of my area.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it,
	    it's too horrible. No.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: What?</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: No, I can't.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I
	    didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking
	    that, you know, maybe you could take one.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler and Monica enter.]</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great
	    things about you guys.</p>

	<p><b>Colleen</b>: Oh, please, we're happy to help.</p>

	<p><b>Bill</b>: We went through the same thing when we were adopting.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this
	    room, huh?</p>

	<p>(Bill and Colleen look shocked.)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I mean, you have a lovely home.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.</p>

	<p><b>Colleen</b>: Well, actually, I think this might help.</p>

	<p>(She gives Monica a big binder that's perfectly in order.)</p>

	<p><b>Colleen</b>: It's pretty much all the information you need.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh my god!</p>

	<p><b>Colleen</b>: Everything is broken down into categories, and then
	    cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms
	    in the back.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.</p>

	<p><b>Bill</b>: I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it.
	    Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?</p>

	<p>(Monica looks at him.)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: It's.. It's just so pretty and white.</p>

	<p><b>Colleen</b>: The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.</p>

	<p>(Chandler leaves.)</p>

	<p><b>Colleen</b>: I would have told him to do it too.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Can I adopt you?</p>

	<p>(Cut to the hall. Owen is wearing his scout-uniform and is looking
	    through a box when Chandler walks up to him.)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Hey, you must be Owen.</p>

	<p><b>Owen</b>: Yeah.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.</p>

	<p><b>Owen</b>: You were?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.</p>

	<p><b>Owen</b>: Huh?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You know how to use a compass?</p>

	<p><b>Owen</b>: I have a badge in it.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You do? That's fantastic!</p>

	<p><b>Owen</b>: You wanna see it?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your
	    parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.</p>

	<p><b>Owen</b>: What?!?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: What?</p>

	<p><b>Owen</b>: I'm adopted?</p>

	<p>(Chandler tries to come up with a good answer.)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I got nothing.</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is totally wasted, but he's still
	    drinking all the margaritas.]</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second
	    batch is gooooood.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us.
	    Just hangin'.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us.
	    There's no weirdness, no tension.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: No awareness.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh!
	    Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?</p>

	<p>(The oven timer pings in the kitchen.)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: My fajitas!!</p>

	<p>(He runs off to the kitchen.)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a
	    little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he
	    normally doesn't drink like this.</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging
	    alcoholic.</p>

	<p>(Joey and Rachel don't know how to respond to that.)</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?</p>

	<p>(Ross enters carrying a frying pan with fajitas - without any oven
	    mitts.)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!</p>

	<p>(Ross laughs.)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: That is gonna hurt tomorrow!</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there.
	    Continued from earlier.]</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me
	    taking one of your kids, can we?</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: No, of course we're not.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Insane.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: I know.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Alice would never go for it, right?</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've
	    got her onboard.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know,
	    hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Huh.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Frank Jr.Jr.?</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know,
	    he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Uh-huh.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: What's green and says &quot;hey, I'm a frog&quot;? A talking frog!
	    (Laughs.) Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that
	    knows how to burp the alphabet.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Alright, so that leaves Chandler.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my
	    little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a
	    realtor..</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I
	    can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but
	    they're my babies.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You
	    know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You
	    name the day, and I'll be there.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: How about tomorrow?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff
	    around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day
	    together.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b>: You'd do that for us?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.</p>

	<p><b>Frank Jr.</b> (looks at the triplets): Look at them! Aw. I love you so
	    much. (Strokes Leslie's hair, and she moves a little.) Oh crap, don't
	    wake up, don't wake up!</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler comes running into the
	    living room. Monica is the only one there.]</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Where are Bill and Colleen?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you
	    believe how nice they are?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: We have to leave!!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Why? What did you do in the bathroom?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way,
	    and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may
	    have told him.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace
	    everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!</p>

	<p>(Bill and Colleen enter.)</p>

	<p><b>Colleen</b>: Hey.</p>

	<p><b>Bill</b>: Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the
	    sour worms. Those are for Owen.</p>

	<p><b>Colleen</b>: I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we
	    haven't told him he's adopted yet.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he
	    already knows?</p>

	<p>(Owen comes running in.)</p>

	<p><b>Owen</b>: I'm adopted?!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: See? Intuitive!</p>

	<p><b>Bill</b>: What? Where did you hear that?</p>

	<p><b>Owen</b>: He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Which technically now you should give back!</p>

	<p><b>Colleen</b>: You told him he's adopted?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or
	    something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the
	    door. &quot;Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa
	    is real.&quot;</p>

	<p><b>Owen</b>: He isn't?!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b> (to Monica): We have to get out of here, baby!</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment. Rachel, Joey and Charlie are eating fajitas
	    when Ross enters from the kitchen.]</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ooy.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is
	    life without love?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: O is for &quot;oh, wow!&quot; The V is for this very surprising turn
	    of
	    events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely
	    normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might
	    get married and have children of your own.</p>

	<p>(Ross chokes up and pauses. Rachel and Joey look at him.)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Dude, are you okay?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Totally.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ross, you don't seem okay.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b> (on the verge of tears): I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of
	    entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: No!</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but
	    this has been lovely.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and
	    that you never really liked Rachel.</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Okay.</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Alright.</p>

	<p>(Ross goes to the kitchen.)</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Bye.</p>

	<p>(Ross enters from the kitchen with three plates with flan.)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple
	    now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: No, no, it's just that it's getting late...</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of
	    margaritas. It's all good.</p>

	<p>(The oven timer pings again.)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: I don't even know what that's for.</p>

	<p>(He goes back to the kitchen.)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's
	    okay.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever
	    gonna be okay with this.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: It doesn't look good, does it?</p>

	<p>(They kiss each other on the cheek, and Rachel leaves.)</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Ross's apartment the next morning. Ross is very hung-over on
	    the couch as Joey enters with a cup of coffee for him.]</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Morning. Here you go.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Thanks. Did you stay here all night?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: So you took off my pants and shoes?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the
	    Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you
	    don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: What do you mean?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do
	    anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're
	    not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six
	    years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: That's what I hear, yeah.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys
	    aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is
	    this thing with you and Rachel?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Joey.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I'm crazy about her.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: And she feels the same way?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I think so.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie,
	    right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't
	    see the dance, did she?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure
	    about this?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Yeah, I'm sure.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: And we're okay?</p>

	<p>(Ross smiles and holds up his hand for a high-five, but he has
	    forgotten about his burnt hands. He gasps in pain as Joey grabs his
	    hand.)</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Hey, Phoebs</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hey.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: What?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Still, he had to find out sometime.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets
	    that you gave birth to them?</p>

	<p>(The triplets stare at him.)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)</p>
