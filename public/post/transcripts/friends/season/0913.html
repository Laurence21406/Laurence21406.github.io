	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Hey!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what
	    happened here last night?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like
	    you! Do you believe that who ever<BR>did something over here last night did what
	    they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: No!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from
	    her office out on your balcony.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica
	    we should put lights on our balcony. And she said<BR>"No, no. It's too cold,
	    nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they
	    will"</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel
	    kissing some guy on your balcony,<BR>even though there were NO LIGHTS !</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: So are you gonna...talk to her?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's
	    fine!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it
	    and spits!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care
	    but...at least she could have told me. You know<BR>I...I've been putting my life
	    on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing
	    guys she<BR>barely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah!
	    Ah!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where
	    you're moving?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now
	    there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.<BR>And then the other
	    day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who
	    totally came on to me during the inter-departmental<BR>Potluck dinner.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Why did I get married?!</p>

	<p align=center><b>Opening Credits</b></p>

	<p>[Scene: Central Perk]</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken
	    tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks I<BR>should have my eyebrows
	    waxed. Is that weird for a guy?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Well it depends.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: On...?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: On how far along he's in the sex change process!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do
	    something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,<BR>your eyebrows
	    are...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Oh man! I have to get those done too?!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Wow! Talking about high maintenance</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Hey hey! You dye your hair!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: I'm a woman!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Arghhh! Double standards!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar
	    tonight?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Only if I don't have to get up and sing.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable
	    old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped out<BR>and everyone
	    booed him off the stage. So funny.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: It's just, I'm not good at singing.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better
	    singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to
	    sing.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass
	    judgments on others?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: While drinking...</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: I'm there!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something
	    really stupid.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out
	    there</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh my god.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: You kissed him?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony
	    and...</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed
	    that?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping
	    paper.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me
	    and, oh and he gave me this scarf...</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: I thought you hated him?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and
	    it turns out that line...is a scarf!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: So are you thinking of starting up something with this
	    guy?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you
	    know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don't<BR>know what to do
	    and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin,
	    and you definitely should talk to Ross</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss
	    a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Beauty salon]</p>

	<p><b>Salon girl</b>: Hi</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.</p>

	<p><b>Salon girl:</b> Name?</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> Chandler Bing.</p>

	<p><b>Salon girl:</b> Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia
	    will be right with you.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: OK Thanks.<BR>(Joey touches the hot wax). I touched the
	    stuff</p>

	<p><b>Sonia</b>: I'll take care of it</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?</p>

	<p><b>Sonia</b>: Oh absolutely.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Oh good...</p>

	<p><b>Sonia</b>: Are you looking to meet somebody?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: All right let's just do this.</p>

	<p><b>Sonia</b>: We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of
	    the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My
	    face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!<BR>Just a little bit of shock
	    that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK<BR>(He tries to avoid the
	    tweezers) Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Central Perk]</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on
	    going?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand
	    but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I
	    mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,<BR>two
	    illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to
	    me</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just
	    an impulsive one-time birthday thing</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a
	    bar.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Did she go out with him?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Ah! The high road...</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey
	    check out those two blondes over there!<BR>Hey come with me!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Are you trying to get everybody divorced?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the
	    two of us, like college, remember? You...you break the<BR>ice with some kind of
	    jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some
	    interesting conversation, so<BR>they'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding,
	    sexy one...</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I thought I had to make the jokes!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Don't you have to be at work?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend
	    Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. <BR>We only
	    need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the
	    paper...another flood in Europe? Here’s a question: "Would you...<BR>would you
	    rather drown or be burnt alive?"</p>

	<p><b>Blonde girl</b>: Sorry...we were just leaving</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: We still got it!</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Ross']</p>


	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Who is it?</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: Gavin! I brought you some soup.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Why?</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: I heard you were sick...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little
	    bit! Hello Gavin</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I
	    thought you called in sick to avoid me.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh no no no</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: So I had fun last night</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: So did I</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold
	    for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: It's just a cold</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: What? What's the matter?</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: What's Ross doing to you on that picture?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be
	    funny.</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want
	    to get in the middle of anything</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything,
	    don't worry about Ross really, really.<BR>(She hears the noise of the key in the
	    lock) Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: Yeah! But you said not to worry about...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!</p>

	<p><b>Molly</b>: Hi!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.</p>

	<p><b>Molly</b>: No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Right, right, yes!</p>

	<p><b>Molly</b>: Don't panic!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: What?</p>

	<p><b>Molly</b>: There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my
	    purse.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my
	    business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.<BR>Gavin come out from behind
	    that curtain!</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand
	    there.</p>

	<p><b>Molly</b>: Hello! I just go and get Emma.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: OK.</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: So hum...Why did I have to hide?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: I thought it was Ross.</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between
	    you two...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: There isn't. There is totally isn't.</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming
	    out of a chute for the first time. I used to be a<BR>rodeo clown.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were
	    here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not in<BR>any relationship
	    but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus
	    there is just so much<BR>history...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry,
	    I'm just all over the place.</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a
	    piece of advice?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yes</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: I think you should talk to Ross about all this.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: Don't be. It's just bad timing.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: So seriously...rodeo clown?</p>

	<p><b>Gavin</b>: One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...</p>



	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Mike's piano bar]</p>



	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: "No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the
	    world...!" Thank you!</p>

	<p>(Mike kisses Phoebe)</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to
	    get a break and when we come back we've got Kenneth<BR>singing "I touch
	    myself"...I'm not here to judge!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: No I told you I can't.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice
	    voice.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: What have you heard me sing?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: All the time when you're cooking.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: What?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in
	    my tummy"</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Yeah I do rock that one.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up
	    there?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I
	    would sing...</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Well I've got a book around...</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: "Delta Dawn"</p>



	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Central Perk]</p>



	<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace</p>

	<p><b>Woman</b>: You already hit on me an hour ago</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep
	    striking out.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate,
	    you're asking women how they want to be killed</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the
	    one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: By drowning or...?!</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: Why would he break up with me?</p>

	<p><b>Her friend</b>: I don't know sweetie.</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back.
	    I mean, am I so unlovable?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Well...</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> I know! (he stands)</p>





	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Piano bar]</p>



	<p><b>Mike</b>: All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of
	    "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monica<BR>singing "Delta
	    Dawn".</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that
	    spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyone<BR>anyway.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn"<BR>"Delta
	    Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone
	    by? ..."</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Can you totally see through her shirt ?</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: "To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"</p>



	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's]</p>



	<p><b>Joey</b>: Hey, I need your help.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley
	    Judd?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my
	    eyebrows shaped</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: You may be a sissy but I'll still (pound you out on ground). All
	    right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do one<BR>eyebrow and now... they
	    don’t match!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: It’s like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic
	    marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one so<BR>I don’t look stupid for my
	    pictures.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Ok. First of all, this is green!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: What the hell am I supposed to do!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you
	    will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: What, what.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the
	    lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mine<BR>by plucking the eyebrows
	    of my father and his “business” partners.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Oh my God!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Yeah, well, I guess you don’t need my help Victor
	    Victoria!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help,
	    but Chandler I don’t know if I can take anymore<BR>plucking. It hurts so
	    bad!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my
	    gentle self-loathing touch.</p>



	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Piano Bar]</p>



	<p><b>Monica</b>: "Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is
	    over. Did you see me out there?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Every little bit of you!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: I can’t believe I did this. I can’t believe I'm singing for the
	    people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear that<BR>one shouting “look at those
	    tips”! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Sure.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Mon', not that you didn’t sound good, but...</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Good? Didn’t you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for
	    making me do this. That’s is the best gift ever.</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Also a good gift? Underwear.</p>



	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Ross']</p>



	<p><b>Michelle</b>: Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms
	    freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone do<BR>anything else.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> But, what’s great is that you don’t mind talking about it.</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: It’s so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with
	    me, because it’s like you lose a boyfriend,<BR>you get a boyfriend.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-ah!</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: No don’t worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally
	    over Eric.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> (pfew). Good choice Ross.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I’ve been looking for you
	    everywhere!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o’ clock.
	    So I was hoping you and I could have a<BR>chance to kind of talk… somebody
	    here?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yeah, yeah that’s Michelle.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Who?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, just this woman I’ve been seeing.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: You’ve being seeing someone?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, didn’t I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven’t being going
	    out for too long, but rather there is this<BR>amazing connection between us. I-I
	    mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it
	    was<BR>a little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: What are you taking amoxicillin for?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look
	    through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that’s<BR>my roommate, Rachel.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Hi, and I am also Emma’s mother.</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: Ah, who is Emma?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> I told you about my daughter.</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!</p>



	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Monica and Chandler's]</p>



	<p><b>Chandler</b>: And done!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Oh my God! I didn’t feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a
	    job because you can tweeze circles around<BR>that sadistic bitch at the
	    saloon</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look
	    great! How you doing!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little
	    worried I was uncovering a birthmark right about<BR>there, but it turned out to

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Thank you so much.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: No problem.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Listen that’s a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some
	    manly make up for it.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Yeah.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Comb my eyelashes.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Ok, for my next song I think I’ll sing something a little more
	    upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the Pointer<BR>Sisters “I am so excited”. And
	    make it bouncy!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh you’ll probably take care of that on your hands.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I am sorry I am late. You’ll understand when you’ll see
	    Joey.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Honey, you’re just in time, I’m about to sing another
	    song!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Really? In front of all this people?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: And they love me!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Oh my God!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yes, she gives the people what they want.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: All right, watch!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll
	    put all other things aside. Give in this<BR>time and show me some
	    affection..."</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Are those my wife’s nipples?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh? Isn’t that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have
	    let her go up again.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I gotta stop this.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You, touching yourself, out!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Wow. She does that a lot!</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: Ross, you didn’t tell me you were a doctor!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: What, what, wait a minute! You haven’t even told her you were a
	    doctor, yet? How long have you known her, like<BR>an hour?</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: Actually about an hour and a half.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> I told you it wasn’t long, but there is an amazing connection
	    between us.</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Are you kidding?</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> We’ll see.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ok, Ross, what’s going on here, are we just bringing strange
	    women back to the apartment now?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> I don’t know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: How do you know about that?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to
	    sleep...</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: Emma.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a
	    guy you know, for what? A week?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, that’s what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to
	    get back at me?</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: No, actually, see I had to pee, ‘cause I can’t use public
	    bathrooms because the doodie parasites.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok, Michelle, it’s time to go.</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: Well, call me!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok.</p>

	<p><b>Michelle</b>: No, wait, you don’t have my phone number!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> You know, if it’s meant to be, I’ll guess it. Bye, bye.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Score.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we
	    could come to one of your kissing parties on<BR>the balcony.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh God, I can’t believe you’re making such a big deal about this.
	    It was one kiss, one guy, one time!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, really!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, really!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh yeah.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: What about the guy from the bar?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: What? Who?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> The guy you gave your number to.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Whoa, how do you know about that?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Because he called here looking for you. So don’t tell me
	    this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,<BR>ok? You’ve been
	    out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn’t even
	    have the courtesy to tell me.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Why didn’t I get that message?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> What?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: From the guy in the bar, why didn’t I get that message?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you
	    not look there?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ross?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> I never gave it to you.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Why?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> I don’t know.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to
	    decide what messages I should or should not get?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Who am I?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yes.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> I am the guy who’s taking care of our baby while you’re out at bars
	    meeting guys!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in
	    here hoping to have a mature conversation with you<BR>About us! But I can’t do
	    that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my
	    apartment!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That’s not the
	    point. Ok? The point is you...you are the one<BR>Who moved on and didn’t tell
	    anyone!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What’s wrong with us? You
	    know when people hear about our situation they<BR>Always ask, “what, you live
	    together but you’re not a couple? And you have a baby, isn’t that weird?» And I
	    say “No.<BR>You know what, it’s not, because it works for us!» But you know this
	    doesn’t work. In fact this is the opposite of working!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Uh, clearly.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as
	    long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,<BR>Just doesn’t make sense
	    anymore.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?</p>



	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Joey's]</p>



	<p><b>Joey</b>: Hey!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Ha, oh, of course.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Thank you.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Your eyebrows look weird.</p>
