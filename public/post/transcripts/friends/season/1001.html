	<p>[Scene: Barbados, Monica and Chandler's Room. They both enter from Ross's
	    room. Monica still has her big, frizzy hair.]</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such
	    a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: I'll put a pillowcase over my head.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You're on!</p>

	<p>(they start to get ready, but then Phoebe enters through the door from Ross's
	    room)</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hey!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: What's up?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the
	    way there's  no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you
	    want...</p>

	<p>(there's a door slamming in Ross's room, and some indistinct murmuring)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: ... finally...</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Is that Ross?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid
	    walls.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Sounds like he's with someone.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: He could be alone. This morning I heard him do
	    push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I
	    hear someone else in there with him.</p>

	<p>(they all put their ear against the wall to be able to hear what's
	    being said. We move to Ross's room where he and Charlie are kissing.)</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Ooh... Dr. Geller!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to <em>ask</em> you
	    to call me that.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh my God, that's Charlie!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: She's cheating on Joey with Ross!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh that tart... floozy... giant...</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: I'm not sure about this.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: No I'm not sure that it's  the best way to hear
	    everything. Someone get me a glass!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop
	    on my friend.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: (through wall) Ooh... I <em>love<b> </b></em>Barbados!  </p>

	<p>(Phoebe starts to listen at the other wall, where Rachel's room is. There,
	    Joey and Rachel are kissing.)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. <b>I'm
	    kissing Rachel!</b></p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: I know, I'm her!</p>

	<p>(they start to kiss again, and Phoebe turns to Chandler and Monica)</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: (whispering) Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: What?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Get over here!</p>

	<p>(Chandler and Monica take a sprint to the other wall)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: ooh...</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Wow!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: (in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!) Oh my God,
	    I love how thin these walls are!</p>

	<p>(In the rooms next door, Joey, Rachel, Ross and Charlie stop kissing and try
	    to understand what the yelling was about. After a while they continue kissing.
	    We're back in Chandler and Monica's room. Monica has some of her own hair
	    stuffed in her mouth by Chandler.)</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: (muffled) Thank you.</p>

	<p align="center"><b>OPENING CREDITS</b></p>

	<p>(Rachel and Joey's)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Hey, you know, before you said
	    that nothing could happen between us? What changed?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then
	    I saw him kissing Charlie...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really
	    making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?</p>

	<p>(Chandler and Monica's)</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: How about the dinosaur twins in the other room?
	    No-one is manning that wall!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: I'm on it!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Anything?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: I think I hear curtains closing... </p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: We've got shoes being kicked off over here.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Bedsprings, unmistakable!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You do realise  that's your brother?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler
	    makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall.
	    Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey
	    and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people  leaving with the
	    same person we came with.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving
	    with Weird Al.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning,
	    before we leave, I'm going to the salon.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Okay Buckwheat!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free
	    porn! (Chandler eagerly rushes over)</p>

	<p>(Ross and Charlie's)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Weh...*sigh*</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: uhm... Is everything okay?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread,
	    because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could
	    just...</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where
	    they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up.
	    Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: I uhm... I completely understand.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Alright, I'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit,
	    looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing
	    up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries
	    to concentrate...) Okay, I see you later.</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Okay...</p>

	<p>(Chandler and Monica's, all three of them are listening at the wall to
	    Ross and Charlie's)</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: That's the door. He's gone...</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: And she's... turning on the TV... and watching...
	    Miss Congeniality!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it
	    too well!</p>

	<p>(They are still listening at the wall, when Ross enters their room)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Hey, what are you guys doing?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying
	    goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort
	    and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: (also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank
	    you! (walks to Phoebe)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: (caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend
	    Charlie. That's the situation as <em>we</em> know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Well, if you see him could you <em>please</em> tell
	    him I'm looking for him?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You got it!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the
	    wall) Thank you! (closes the door)</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Other wall, people! Other wall!</p>

	<p>(they rush to the wall to Rachel and Joey's, and we move to that room)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: (knocks on door) Rach,  you there? (Joey and Rachel
	    both get up from the bed)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he
	    knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like
	    stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking
	    up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: No idea what it means.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh... okay, just hide!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: (knocks) Rach?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!</p>

	<p>(When Rachel
	    starts to look under the bed if Joey would fit under there, Chandler opens
	    the door inbetween the rooms, grabs Joey by his shirt and drags him to his
	    room, and closes the door again)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: There's no room under the bed. (looks around because
	    she can't find Joey anymore)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Is everything okay?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went, and
	    opens the door)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Hey.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Hi...</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: You know where Joey is?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: ...I really don't... (looks around again)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Can I talk to you for a minute?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if
	    Joey is there)</p>

	<p>(Monica and Chandler's room. Phoebe, Monica and Chandler have their ears pressed
	    against the wall, and Joey looks at them)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I don't believe this... Have you guys been...</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Shhh... This is the <em>listening</em> side of the
	    wall.</p>

	<p>(Now Joey also wants to listen, and wants to press his ears against the door,
	    which has a big mirror on it, he hesitates seeing himself in the mirror, but
	    still puts his ear against it. We move again to Rachel's room.)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up,
	    and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: (clearly not listening and still trying to find out
	    where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the
	    day I met her.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: (still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been
	    really hard for you.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before
	    you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna
	    be?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say,
	    Ross. That is hard to say.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: You would think!</p>

	<p>(Ross leaves the room)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Joey!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Is he gone?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: (still can't find him) How are you doing this?</p>

	<p>(Joey now enters the room through the door, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe are
	    following him.)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Pssst...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this?
	    Have you guys been listening this entire time?</p>

	<p><b>Monica, Chandler and Phoebe</b>: YE-AH!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Now, what is this?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ah, what <em>is</em> this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten
	    minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth
	    grade!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated
	    this could get? What about Ross?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Well, he's with Charlie now.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything
	    really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think
	    he deserves the same from you?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: (long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in
	    my ass, Geller!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all
	    the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you
	    do <em>one </em>thing for us? The people that  care about you?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Sure...</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Enunciate!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Get out!</p>

	<p>(They leave and Rachel locks the door.)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Are they right?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off
	    until we talk to Ross.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah... <em>Yeah</em>, we can wait, we don't have
	    to do anything <em>tonight</em>.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna...
	    I'm gonna take off...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: (Joey walks to the door) Although... </p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: (turns around very fast) I like although!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like...
	    six years...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Absolutely! He's not thinking about <em>you</em>.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: No...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I'm thinking about you...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Let's forget about Ross...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Forgotten.</p>

	<p>(They want to kiss, but just before their lips touch, Rachel pulls back quickly,
	    gasping)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: What's wrong?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Nothing...</p>

	<p><b>Joey's voice, but she sees Ross</b>: Seriously... What is it?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here,
	    come here...</p>

	<p>(again, just before their lips touch, she pulls back, gasping)</p>

	<p><b>Joey's voice/Ross</b>: What's wrong?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out
	    of my head...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately,
	    closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late,
	    and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel/Ross</b>: Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do
	    that again... (and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head
	    away again...)</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...</p>

	<p><b>Both</b>: Yeah</p>

	<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

	<p>[Scene: Chandler and Monica's room. Chandler is packing when Ross knocks on
	    the door and enters...]</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Hey!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Hey!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: You guys ready to go?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm
	    just finishing packing.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Dude! You're not taking your Bible?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's
	    a New Testament, what are <em>you</em> gonna do with it?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Learn about Jesus...</p>

	<p>(Charlie now also enters the room, Chandler walks to the bathroom)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Hey!</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: So, did you talk to Joey?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk
	    to him on the plane.</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Yeah, sounds like a good idea... <em>Dr.</em> Geller!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Stop it!</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: PHD</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: You're filthy!</p>

	<p>(Phoebe enters)</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hey, have you guys seen Monica?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...</p>

	<p>(Monica enters, with her hair braided and little shells at the end)</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Check it out!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Who's day just got better? <b>CHANDLER!</b></p>

	<p>(Chandler enters from the bathroom)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: What do you think?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: I think.... I think I can see your scalp.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Don't you just love it?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: It's so... something... <em>You go girlfriend!</em></p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: You've never said that in your life, have you?</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Not once.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: I thought so.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells
	    tingle)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes <em>and</em> the
	    ears.</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Boarding the plane.]</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting
	    next to Charlie after we broke up.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care
	    about your social life.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference
	    with Charlie.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I understand...</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: No, I'll do it. (he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass
	    and gives Joey his one.)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't
	    wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.</p>

	<p>(Switch to Phoebe and Mike, who are kissing)</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain
	    turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: You should be careful when checking your overhead bins,
	    'cause items may shift during...</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Aaah... you're not good at this...</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: You don't have to go home tonight, do you?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Oh...</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: What?</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Why not?</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: I have a date.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: You have a... You have a date? With who?</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Oh, it's... my girlfriend.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: (lets go of his hand) You have...  have a girlfriend?</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started
	    seeing someone.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: For how long?</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Three months.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my
	    business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I
	    promise.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you
	    get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the
	    packing material...</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave
	    it there.</p>

	<p>(cut to Charlie and Ross)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the
	    right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says &quot;duty
	    free&quot;.</p>

	<p><b>Charlie</b>: Okay... Good luck.</p>

	<p>(Ross gets up and gestures to Rachel, we cut to Joey and Rachel)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really
	    good time to talk to him.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done,
	    they'll probably be serving dinner.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Ooh...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Still nervous?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I'm gonna get the lasagna.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Hey Rach...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths &quot;Good luck&quot; to
	    Joey and gets up from her seat)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Hey!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Hey!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Okay, last night after you guys broke up... <em>so</em> sorry
	    to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...,
	    well...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: You kissed.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I saw you.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else
	    happened, okay.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: What?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: It's <em>okay</em>. You know, I totally understand,
	    alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And...
	    I want you to be happy.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Are you serious?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah... Now I have something...</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put
	    my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know
	    that?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Oh... uh...  look... before you...</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless,
	    and generous...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I am those things, yeah.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always
	    think of him as my best friend, but <em>now</em>... I may have to rethink some
	    stuff...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: <em>Dude!</em></p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I can't think of anything.</p>

	    smiles.)</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Thanks!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah.</p>

	<p>(Ross walks to the back of the plane, where Rachel is.)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: So hi!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Hi!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: So you eh, you talked to Joey?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh! That's great!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Yeah!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh, so everything's okay?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing
	    guy.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Well, I'm so excited about this.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Really? Excited?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Are you kidding? I have had some <em>very</em> dirty dreams
	    about this...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still
	    looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and
	    hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things
	    about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge
	    on Chandler.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget
	    it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.</p>

	<p>(Chandler walks by and Joey lets out an evil &quot;muhahaho&quot;.)</p>

	<p>[Scene: Mike's apartment. Phoebe's there and the phone rings.]</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hi, Mike's place.</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Hey, it's Mike.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Ooh, that was fast.</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think
	    I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap
	    on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know,
	    women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while.
	    Just F.Y.I.</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious
	    on my coffee table.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you
	    pick her up at the pound?</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b>: Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up. </p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch
	    her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)</p>

	<p>(there's knocking on the door which Phoebe opens)</p>

	<p><b>Precious</b>: Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: (stunned) I... I'm Phoebe.</p>

	<p><b>Precious</b>: Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of
	    his life? That Phoebe?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Enchant&eacute; (she holds out her hand, and they shake
	    hands)</p>

	<p>[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. Monica's carrying the laundry hamper

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these...
	    (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You go back to work tomorrow night, right?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Yeah!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: So if you want people to see them, then by definition
	    you're not  having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be
	    able to do <em>this</em>. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her
	    hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she
	    brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: What are you singing?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: It's &quot;Bolero&quot; from &quot;10&quot;.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: It's &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; from &quot;Apocalypse
	    Now&quot;...
	    See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy
	    hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore,
	    so if you think about it... <em>I <b>hate</b> them!</em></p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: You what? You said you liked them.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was
	    that I could see your scalp.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel
	    said, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey...
	    Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: You know what? I don't care. I like it like this,
	    and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this...
	    (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: And the eye!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: (gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed
	    you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you <em>so</em> much. Hey... Did you have
	    a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants
	    again <b>to use as a rattle</b>? (to Rachel)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: That was one time, Ross, and they were only like

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay?
	    Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really

	<p><b>Ross</b>: (unpacking his bag) Okay, shoot!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: (gasps) <b>OH NO!</b></p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: What? What is it?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Oh, major shampoo explosion!</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Oh, it's all over <b>everything</b>. Why?
	    Why me? (looks up)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser.
	    It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do <em>bad</em> things happen to good people?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b>: Duh, <b>you think</b>? (enters the kitchen)</p>

	<p>[Scene: Mike's place. Phoebe is on the phone.]</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See,
	    you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at
	    the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong.
	    Point is... I'm gonna take off.</p>

	<p><b>Precious</b>: I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's
	    going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?</p>

	<p><b>Precious</b>: My name is Precious.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be
	    straight with you... Mike and I <em>are</em> back together... and uhm... unfortunately
	    that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about
	    that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.</p>

	<p><b>Precious</b>: I just can't believe this... Why?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Well, I don't...</p>

	<p><b>Precious</b>: Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong
	    with me?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.</p>

	<p><b>Precious</b>: I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe: Damn it woman, pull yourself together! </b>Have
	    some pride,<b> for the <em>love</em> of God.</b></p>

	<p>(Precious starts crying)</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Okay, not a fan of the tough love.</p>

	<p><b>Precious</b>: I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any
	    warning.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning
	    on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...</p>

	<p><b>Precious</b>: He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday  <em>ever</em>.
	    (she starts to cry again)</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Look, <em>Precious...</em> Mike's not worth this.
	    You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a
	    wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna
	    break-up with you on your <em>birthday</em>? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell,
	    but he cheated on you <em>a lot</em> this weekend.</p>

	<p><b>Precious</b>: Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need
	    him. I deserve to be treated with respect.</p>

	<p>(Mike enters the apartment.)</p>

	<p><b>Precious</b>: Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard,
	    and I hope you rot in hell. </p>

	<p>(she slaps him in the face, Mike looks like he

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Not really. </p>

	<p>(Chandler enters the bathroom, and Monica is standing there in a towel, with
	    her hair stuck in the shower curtain.)</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: I have a problem.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: Really? What happened?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Well, I was dancing around, and singing &quot;No Woman,
	    No Cry&quot; and I got stuck.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: You can't move at all?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth
	    the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair
	    as she goes)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler</b>: If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the
	    corn rose?</p>

	<p><b>Monica</b>: (looking disappointed) I guess so...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: So, did you err... did you tell Ross?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related
	    emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better
	    if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if
	    he gets mad, all you have to do is go... <em>I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.</em> (he
	    pushes  his breasts together from the side)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Yeah, 'cause <em>that's</em> what we do.</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how
	    about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again
	    we can't...</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can
	    control ourselves, we're not animals.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that
	    means good night then?</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss
	    on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Goo--ood night!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but
	    this time it lasts longer)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Seriously, good night!</p>

	<p><b>Joey</b>: Stop saying good night.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel</b>: Okay.</p>

	<p>(Now they kiss passionately... and then Ross enters with Emma. They freeze,
	    pull away and look at Ross who looks like he just can't believe what he's seeing.
