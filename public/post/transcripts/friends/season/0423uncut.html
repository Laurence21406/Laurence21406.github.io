	    <p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are getting ready for the flight to
		London and Monica comes running in.]</p>

	    <p><b>Monica:</b> Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get
		a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there
		could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.</p>
	    <font color="#0000ff">

		<p><b>Joey:</b> What do you got there?</p>


		<p><b>Chandler:</b> Condoms, dude!</p>


		<p><b>Joey </b>(looks at the box): How come the writing is in Spanish?</p>


		<p><b>Chandler:</b> Don't read my condoms!</p>
	    </font>

	    <p>[Cut to the girls' apartment, Monica is putting things into her purse as Phoebe and
		Rachel watch.]</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera,
		check! Traveller's cheques, check! </p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> Who are you saying &quot;check&quot; too?</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing,
		you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realised it was weird.</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did
		it the one time. But it was pretty weird.</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> (entering) Hey!</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> Hey!</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! Are you ready yet?</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> Yep! You got the tickets?</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Oh! Got 'em right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!</p>

	    <p>[Cut to the guys' apartment.]</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> It's all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than
		enthused Chandler and starts towards the girls' apartment.)</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> You got your passport?</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.</p>

	    <p>(Chandler glares at him. At first Joey doesn't know why, it takes him a little bit to
		figure it out.)</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> There it is.</p>


	    <p align="center">Opening Credits</p>


	    <p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, Monica is telling Phoebe where
		everything is.]</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah,
		the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator...</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this
		stuff?</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, okay, give that a try!</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, with Joey) All right! Let's do it!</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> Woo-hoo!!</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, cheerie-o! </p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> London baby!</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> (louder) London baby!!</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your
		wedding, but I don't-can't get up.</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, have a great wedding!</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks.</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey! (Trots over)</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in
		your apartment.</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebe's book as Rachel comes in from her room.)</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> (to Rachel) So, we're off.</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> Have fun!</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I know.</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> So-so come! Why don't you come?</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> This is my wedding.</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> (entering, with Phoebe's book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo!
		Phewbedo! Phaybobo.</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> (laughs) Thank you.</p>

	    <p>(Chandler kneels down with his arms spread waiting for his hug.</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> Bye, Pheebs!</p>

	    <p>(They all start out, Rachel gives each one a kiss, and says &quot;bye.&quot; In the
		hall, Joey says...)</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!</p>

	    <p>(And with that, television history is made as, for the first time ever, an entire show
		moves it's entire production to an entirely different country to make a single episode. We
		get shots of Buckingham Palace, London Bridge, Big Ben, and the London Marriott as Joey
		and Chandler exit.)</p>

	    <br/>

	    <p>[Scene: Street in front of the London Marriott, Joey and Chandler exit. Joey is
		carrying a video camera and is shooting Chandler.]</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> Come on! Do something!</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> I am, I'm ignoring you.</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right,
		first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his &quot;pop-up&quot; map of London. All
		of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, what the hell is that?</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. (Points to the map.) Wait.
		No, we wanna go... No. I know. (Sets the map down.) I'm gonna have to go into the map. (So
		Joey literally steps into the map.)</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire
		time are we?</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)</p>

	    <br/>

	    <p>[Scene: Another street, somewhere along the River Thames, Ross, Emily, and Monica are
		walking to where they're gonna get married. Emily is relating the troubles with the
		caterer.]</p>


	    <p><b>Emily:</b> ...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was
		going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say
		there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna
		be...</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?</p>


	    <p><b>Emily:</b> Well, up yours too!</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> What?! </p>
	    <font color="#0000ff">

		<p><b>Emily:</b> Oh, that's not what it means?</p>
	    </font>

	    <p><b>Ross:</b> No! No! That's-that's time-out!</p>


	    <p><b>Emily:</b> Sorry.</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come
		on.</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> Chicken Kiev?</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant
		than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross pushes her.)
		<font color="#0000ff">But of course with salmon you'd have to worry about the
		    chickenella...</font> So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.</p>


	    <p><b>Emily:</b> I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely
		building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... (She stops suddenly, when she sees that
		demolition has already started.) Oh my God!</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> It's nice.</p>


	    <p><b>Emily:</b> Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)</p>

	    <p>[Cut to inside.]</p>


	    <p><b>Emily:</b> (running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are
		we going to do?</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.</p>


	    <p><b>Emily:</b> How's it gonna be all right?!</p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> Uh-huh, I see that.</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what
		happened. </p>


	    <p><b>Ross:</b> What? What?</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> They tore it down a few days early.</p>

		<p>[Scene: Chandler and Joey are sitting on the top floor on one of the red coaches in
		    London that doesn't have a roof. Joey is very enthusiastic and is pointing at all the
		    different sights. Chandler is really embarrassed and tries to make him stop. Afterwards,
		    Joey tries to film Chandler with his video camera, and Chandler obviously hates this.
		    Then, Joey falls asleep, and Chandler tries to take the video camera away from him.
		    However, Joey is holding onto it (in his sleep) and won't let it go. Chandler pulls until
		    Joey lets it go, causing Chandler to fall out of his seat.]</p>

	    <br/>

	    <p>[Scene: Westminster Abbey, Joey and Chandler have successfully navigated the streets of
		London and are approaching the Abbey.]</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey!
		(Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the
		name of this place.</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> Really? To what?</p>


	    <p><b>Chandler:</b> To Put the Camera Away!!!</p>


	    <p><b>Joey:</b> Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler towards the
		Abbey.)</p>

	    <br/>

	    <p>[Scene: A bridal shop somewhere in London. Monica is trying on her red bridesmaid
		dress, and Emily is watching. A dressmaker is working on Monica's dress.]</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> Don't worry. You'll find some place to get married.</p>

	    <p>(The dressmaker puts a pin in the dress, but accidentally pricks Monica with it.)</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> Oowww!!</p>


	    <p><b>Dressmaker:</b> Sorry. Lucky this dress is red!</p>


	    <p><b>Emily:</b> We can't find another place. Then we can't have the wedding! I've ordered
		chicken and salad and-and cake for 150. What should be the most wonderful day of my life
		is rapidly turning into just Sunday with a spectacular amount of food!</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> You're gonna find a place. But even if - God forbid - you didn't.. So you
		postpone the wedding. Is that really so bad? I mean, think about it. You could take all
		the time you needed to get everything that you want. You could have tulips, you could have
		salmon.... Mmmmm... Salmon!!</p>


	    <p><b>Emily:</b> I suppose it wouldn't be the end of the world... Oh, thank you!</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> But either way... You're gonna get married, you're gonna be happy, my mom's
		gonna like you better than me.</p>

	    <p>(Emily smiles a bit and looks uncomfortable.)</p>


	    <p><b>Monica:</b> Oh, god... She's told you that already, didn't she?!</p>

	    <br/>

	    <p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is trying to move off of the couch as Rachel
		enters.]</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. Oh.</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, no. Oh, nothing.</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, I have a wedgie.</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, that is all you.</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> So-so, what do you want for lunch?</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, I do. What's the matter?</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have
		lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was
		getting married...</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> (interrupting) Still in love with?! </p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah!</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> I'm not in love with Ross!</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that
		would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey,
		y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but
		feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I
		have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in
		love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God!
		Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> We thought you knew!</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> We?!</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> You all know? Does Ross know?</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.</p>


	    <p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!</p>


	    <p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be
		like telling Monica, &quot;Hey, you like things clean.&quot; <font color="#0000ff">Or,
		y'know, &quot;Hey, Joey, you're gay.&quot;</p>

		<p>(Rachel stares at her.)</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> What?!</p>


		<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!</p>
		</font>

		<br/>

		<p>[Scene: A park in London, Joey and Chandler walk up to a souvenir stand.]</p>


		<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>


		<p><b>The Vendor:</b> So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip
		    post cards...</p>


		<p><b>Joey:</b> Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on the
		    front of it.) Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?</p>


		<p><b>Chandler:</b> Well, I don't have to buy that, &quot;I'm with stupid&quot; T-shirt
		    anymore.</p>


		<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)</p>


		<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you
		    think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?</p>


		<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh, I embarrass you? </p>


		<p><b>Chandler:</b> How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?</p>


		<p><b>The Vendor:</b> He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!</p>


		<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?</p>


		<p><b>The Vendor:</b> (looks around) They're all tourists.</p>


		<p><b>Chandler:</b> All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're
		    gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.</p>


		<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If you're gonna make me choose between you and
		    the hat? I choose the hat.</p>


		<p><b>The Vendor:</b> Good choice.</p>


		<p><b>Joey:</b> Thanks.</p>


		<p><b>Chandler:</b> Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going
		    to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away
		    trying to be cool.)</p>
		<font color="#0000ff">

		    <p>(A man walks up to Joey and stares at Chandler and the flower stand. Joey turns around
			to introduce himself.)</p>


		    <p><b>Joey:</b> How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.</p>

		    <p>(Joey shakes his hand. The man looks at him and his hat.)</p>
		</font>

		<br/>

		<p>[Scene: The hotel, Ross's room, Emily is entering.]</p>


		<p><b>Emily:</b> Hello?</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be
		    able to find a new place for the wedding.</p>


		<p><b>Emily:</b> We don't have to.</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?</p>


		<p><b>Emily:</b> No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall
		    being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> She said what?</p>


		<p><b>Emily:</b> She said, &quot;If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we
		    find in a day, well then we should just postpone it.&quot;</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent
		    on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took
		    time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts his pants on
		    backwards.) This isn't right.</p>


		<p><b>Emily:</b> I realise that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll
		    come back when we can do it right.</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out
		    his pants)</p>


		<p><b>Emily:</b> Don't you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We have no
		    choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you
		    understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when
		    we're getting married.</p>


		<p><b>Emily:</b> So what are you saying? It's now or never?</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> No. I'm saying it's now. (He starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)</p>


		<p><b>Emily:</b> Or?</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!</p>


		<p><b>Emily:</b> It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't
		    understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at
		    all! (She storms out.)</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No,
		    wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-(He catches something important in the zipper
		    and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)</p>

		<p align="center"><b>Commercial Break</b></p>

		<p>[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is on the couch as Rachel returns carrying a bunch
		    of shopping bags.]</p>


		<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Hey!</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> (depressed) Hi.</p>


		<p><b>Phoebe:</b> So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> Manhattan does not have enough stores.</p>


		<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Well, I think I can help you get over him.</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> You can?</p>


		<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> Um-hmm.</p>


		<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And a small piece of chocolate.</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>


		<p><b>Phoebe:</b> And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some
		    graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?</p>


		<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the
		    water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna
		    show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about
		    him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.</p>


		<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I
		    love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs it
		    out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and

		    And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease,

		<p><b>Rachel:</b> I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and
		    y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.</p>


		<p><b>Phoebe:</b> Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh,

		<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay.</p>

		<p><b>Ross:</b> Excuse me?</p>


		<p><b>Monica:</b> Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> I don't know. A month?</p>


		<p><b>Monica:</b> Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the
		    first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did!
		    We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered
		    wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of
		    Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most important part is
		    that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just
		    doing the flying nun.</p>


		<p><b>Monica:</b> Sometimes we were.</p>

		<p><b>Monica:</b> Okay.</p>

		<p><b>Joey:</b> Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.</p>


		<p><b>Monica:</b> That's true.</p>

		<p>(Cut to Rachel and Ross.)</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh, hi!</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> Hi!</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so
		    you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a
		    circus freak, you would've said, &quot;I take thee circus freak.&quot; Y'know, it didn't
		    mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand
		    why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you...</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> Right...</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> But it absolutely didn't. (Yelling towards the bathroom) It didn't!! It
		    didn't!!</p>


		<p><b>Joey:</b> (approaching) Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with

		<p><b>Joey:</b> You spit on me man! (Wipes his face.)</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I'm sorry.</p>


		<p><b>Joey:</b> Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> (laughs) Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was
		    because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.</p>


		<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, right!</p>


		<p><b>Rachel:</b> Get the hell out of there, y'know?</p>

		<p>(They all start laughing, and quickly stop when they realise what she just said and run

		<p><b>Ross:</b> (Bangs on the bathroom door) Emily? Emily? I'm coming in. (He opens the door

		<p><b>Rachel:</b> Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth
