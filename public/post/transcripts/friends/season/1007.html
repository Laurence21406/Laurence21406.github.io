	<p>(Joey and Ross enter. Phoebe and Mike are sitting on the couch, reading a magazine.)</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey you guys!</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe</b>: Hey!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Hey, what are you doing?</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's funny, we were doing the same thing!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah!</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea
	    how expensive this stuff was!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the
	    numbers.</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> So what did you two do about it?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting
	    solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact
	    that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> Are you serious?</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity
	    and we just got married at City Hall?</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> I think it would make me wanna marry you even more. (he kisses her)</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> (to Ross) Maybe you do that next time you get married!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. [pause] But
	    maybe the time after that!</p>

	<p>[Chandler's apartment]</p>

	<p>(Monica is cleaning the table, Chandler is sitting on the sofa. Joey enters.)</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hey!</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> What's going on?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning
	    the apartment.</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> (sarcastically) We?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about
	    us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very
	    impressive when the little people know a celebrity.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> (pointing at himself) Little people?</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> (pointing at himself) Celebrity.</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff
	    hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> What...? NO!</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Chandler?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> (he stands up and he feels very offended) I don't, and I'm offended
	    by the insinuation!</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes
	    taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not
	    mine.</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> It isn't mine!</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> (going out with the VCR in his hand) Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!</p>

	<p>[Scene: The New York City Children's fund hallway.]</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> May I help you? </p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one (she
	    gives him a check)</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> Well, this is very generous!</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> Not necessary.</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> And &quot;X&quot; is spelled uhm... &quot;Mike Hannigan&quot;.</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> It does. It feels really good!</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts! (she takes a t-shirt which
	    was on the counter)</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Mhm... it's moist.</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> (he enters) Hi!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, good!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists
	    out there.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Absolutely.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under
	    a bridge!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Oh my God, what!?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and
	    fire!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Be-caaauuuse...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> (upset) All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing
	    incident... when I was little.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Seriously?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden
	    my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut
	    a big chunk of my hair! (crying) And it was uneven for weeks!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> (sarcastic) And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you
	    in the movie!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And
	    I was thinking Claire Danes.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly
	    safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and
	    you'll see!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and
	    there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're
	    gonna return back to earth!</p>

	<p></p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Space is filled with orbiting children. (pause) Look, please, just come
	    on, you know, when you&#8217;ll see the look on Emma&#8217;s face, I swear you
	    won&#8217;t regret it.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> All right!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Good, you don&#8217;t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their
	    irrational fears on their children, do you?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Irrational, huh? All right, well, I&#8217;ll remember that the next
	    time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, yeah, that&#8217;s the same, I am sure there are thirty different
	    species of poisonous swings! ica&#8217;s apartment. Somebody knocks the door]</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Oh my God, the adoption lady is early! </p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> Ok, ok, here we go.</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> Here we go. Stand up straight. (smiling) Big smile. (opens the door
	    and both are smiling exaggeratedly)</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Hello, is this the creepy residence?</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> We&#8217;re waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I&#8217;m glad
	    you&#8217;re here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this (she puts a
	    box on the table and opens it). I don&#8217;t know if you wanna use it, but&#8230;</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won&#8217;t be needing
	    a veil, I actually won&#8217;t be wearing a dress at all!</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding! </p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> No, no, no, we&#8217;re not having a big reception, we took the money
	    we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#8217;s crazy! (Phoebe looks bewildered). I am sorry. I just can&#8217;t
	    imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> We, you know, we&#8217;re different! We don&#8217;t care about having
	    a huge party. (She picks up the veil) This is really nice for you, but, oh,
	    please, I put this on? (she puts it on) And, ow, I look (she looks her reflex
	    image on a toaster), why, well, radiant. (pause) All right, well, who cares,
	    I don&#8217;t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> That&#8217;s right. You&#8217;re making a commitment and that&#8217;s
	    the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> City Hall.</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Ow! (Chandler slaps her on her back) Oh, that sounds nice! I am just
	    there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> It&#8217;s ok, it&#8217;s ok. I made my decision. What I really want
	    is a great big wedding (she covers her mouth)</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Yay!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> But you already gave all your money to charity!</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Well, I&#8217;ll just ask for it back!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> I don&#8217;t think you can do that!</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some
	    stupid kids!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> That&#8217;s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.</p>

	<br/>

	<p>[Scene: The playground. Ross put Emma on the swing and they&#8217;re
	    ready to play]</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, careful.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Rach, she&#8217;s got like three hairs!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> I know (she touches Emma&#8217;s head) but they&#8217;re just so beautiful!
	    Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> I promise you she&#8217;s safe! No watch how much she loves this. </p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok.</p>

	<p><b>Ross</b> (to Emma): Ready sweety?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Here we go! (He starts pushing Emma)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok, careful, ok. (Emma giggles) Oh, she&#8217;s smiling! Oh my God,
	    she does like it!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> See, I told you!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Awe! (Emma laughs) Oh my God! Looks, she&#8217;s a little dare-devil!
	    Oh, let me push, can I push?</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Oh, absolutely!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok. Oh God. (To Ross) Get the camera, it&#8217;s in the diaper bag.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Ok! (he takes the camera and walks backwards to take a shot) See? Scared
	    of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly (a swinging boy knocks him down) Ow! ew York City Children's fund ]</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> We&#8217;re seriously asking for our money back?</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> It&#8217;s for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight,
	    because one of us gonna have to start flirting.</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don&#8217;t
	    think that that&#8217;s ever happened before.</p>

	<p><b>Phoebe </b>(to Mike): Gay, go.</p>

	<p><b>Mike</b> (to the charity guy): Oh my God, I love your shirt!</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> The donation we made earlier, we k&#8230;, we w&#8230;, we want it
	    back.</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> Excuse me?</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn&#8217;t
	    want, but it turns out we do.</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> So you&#8217;re asking us to refund your donation to the children?</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> Yeah! This feels really good.</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> Hey, it&#8217;s not my business, (he takes their check from a
	    drawer) besides it&#8217;s probably a good thing. We really would have been
	    spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing&#8230;</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Hey, that&#8217;s not fair! A person&#8217;s wedding is important!
	    And especially to me! Ok? I didn&#8217;t have a graduation party! And I didn&#8217;t
	    go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an
	    escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to &#8220;kill me&#8221;
	    or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty
	    little man make me feel badly about it.( She storms out)</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> She could have been talking about either one of us.</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> Oh, water would be fine.</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We&#8217;re really excited
	    about getting this process started.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, because we love kids. Love &#8216;em to death.Well, not actually
	    to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount...
	    as allowed by law.</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> Your place is just lovely.</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples
	    in the</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby
	    before to sell me drugs. (Laura looks shocked)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> Oh...</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> I just realized why I remember this place.</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Really? What is it?</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building
	    and it</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> Yes!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> Of course it was!</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he
	    would call ><b>Chandler:</b> RAT BASTARD!</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> What was that?</p>

	    room, but then Joey enters again.)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> What?</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> I forgot my bat.</p>

	<p>(He picks up his bat and holds it up, but then Monica and Laura enter the living
	    room again. When Laura sees Joey, she freezes...)</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> Oh my God!</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And
	    we don't want to buy your bat! (Joey lowers his bat)</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> What are you doing here?</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> (to Chandler) Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> Are you friends with him?</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> I can explain... Joey...</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back
	    here. I can't believe you never called me.</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> Excuse me?</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by
	    the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it...
	    lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> I gave you my number, you never called me.</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of...
	    social work, ok, that you can just... do.</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> (embarrassed towards Chandler and Monica) Well, I'm pretty sure I gave
	    you my number.</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny,
	    we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You
	    know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? (and he leaves the
	    apartment, leaving her shocked)</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> Joey, wait!</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> (acting sad) NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... (and closes
	    the door behind him)</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> (laughing nervously) I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> Oh, that's really ok.</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.</p>

	<p><b>Laura:</b> Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going
	    to make excellent parents.</p>

	<p>(Chandler and Monica hug each other, and then Joey enters the apartment again.)</p>

	<p><b>Joey:</b> LAURA! (and points to her, very confident)</p>

	<p>[Scene: The New York City Children's Fund building. Phoebe and
	    Mike are entering.]</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> (to the Charity guy) We're back!</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're
	    looking for is an ATM.</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> No, no, we're here to give the money back.</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children. </p>

	<p>(the Charity guy smiles wanting to take the check, but Phoebe pulls it back
	    again. His smile fades.) </p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. (she
	    gives the check and pulls it back again) No... Oh God... Oh!</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> If I haven't said so already sir, (sarcastically pointing to Phoebe)
	    congratulations!</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> (takes the check from Phoebe) Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping
	    in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this
	    decision for us. (thinking) Now... what do you think we should do?</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> You know what? It's not your decision anymore.</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> What?</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> But... but... but we're giving you this!</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it
	    a contribution. (gives the check to Phoebe)</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> (looks at the amount on the check, and gasps) Well, this is very generous!</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful
	    life together.</p>

	<p><b>Mike:</b> Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come
	    back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.</p>

	<p><b><b>Phoebe:</b></b> Oh, is that you?</p>

	<p><b>Charity guy:</b> No!</p>

	<p>[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. They are sitting in
	    their living room when the phone rings.]</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler...
	    Ok, goodbye. (hangs up)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> Wrong number?</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on
	    the waiting list.</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> That's great!</p>

	<p><b>Monica:</b> Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's
	    a baby waiting for us. Oh... </p>

	<p>(Chandler and Monica hug and after a while the telephone rings again... Monica's
	    eyes get bigger. Chandler answers.)</p>

	<p><b>Chandler:</b> Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?</p>

	<p>[Scene: The playground. Ross, Rachel and Emma are still there.
	    Rachel comes walking to Ross and Emma with something between her hands.]</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> (nervously) Ok...</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> Ok... (and passes the spider to Ross who holds it in between his hands)</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> (Gasps and speaks at a higher pitch) This feels perfectly normal. Ok,
	    get on the swing!</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> (reluctantly) Ok... O-k...</p>

	<p>(She slowly grabs the chains of the swing, swings her hair back, and sits down.)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> (more confident) Ok...</p>

	<p>(She slowly walks forward and backward, to gain speed...)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> See?</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> A-alright! I can do this.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used
	    to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> That's because he's on your neck.</p>

	<p><b>Ross:</b> Well... (realizes, screaming like a little girl, trying to get rid of
	    the spider) Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...</p>

	<p>(Ross is now preoccupied with the spider, and forgets that Rachel is still
	    using the swing. While trying to get rid of the spider, he stands in front of
	    Rachel, who bumps into him, throwing him on the ground again.)</p>

	<p><b>Rachel:</b> ROSS!</p>

	<p>(Rachel tries to stop mid-swing, and the swing starts to turn from side to
